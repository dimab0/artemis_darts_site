    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Effective date: February 17, 2026</em></p>

    <p>
      Artemis Darts (the “App”) is provided for entertainment and game-play tracking. This privacy policy explains
      how information is handled when you use the App on iOS.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not require account creation and we do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information.</li>
      <li><strong>Game Data:</strong> The App may store scores, match history, and gameplay preferences on your device so the App can function properly.</li>
      <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Apple may provide anonymous crash or diagnostics data if you have enabled device analytics sharing in iOS settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>Any data used by the App is used only to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide core app features (such as scorekeeping and saved game settings).</li>
      <li>Maintain app stability and improve performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Gameplay data is stored locally on your device. We do not operate a backend account system for Artemis Darts,
      and we do not sell or rent your data.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App may rely on Apple-provided services (such as App Store distribution, optional diagnostics, or
      cloud backup features you enable on your device). Those services are governed by Apple's terms and privacy
      policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from
      children.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can delete app data by removing the App from your device.</li>
      <li>You can manage analytics and diagnostic sharing in iOS Settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised effective date.
